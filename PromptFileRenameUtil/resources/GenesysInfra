Day2 Genesys!
installation of confg server template 
host ip with 
OS - Redhat
SCS- Solution control server (part of management server sends alaram from message server)
LCA - 

for config DB need DAP data access point 
oracle server -jdbc connectivity 

TSAPI (ADDP Protocol) Avaya Switch
Cisco (ICM) for cisco UCM
interfacing with genesys T Server
SIP Tserver (ADDP Protocol) Genesys
-URS for attached data
Day 3
Deploy the app:
Take URL from Tomcat server ending with src-gen/.vxml 
Map it on 
Provisioning ->Voice Platform >IVR Profile >> TEST
Provisioning ->Voice Platform->DID confiure DID
to find out logs
ENV-Business Units 

ENV-> APP ->App NAME-> MCP->reporting Server
Log will print into MCP & Reporting Server as well

MCP->server info and check log file
Reporting Server - > table icon_admin.custom_vars , icon_admin.event_logs using session_id


Seesion ID: only VXML
Conn ID: Routing application generates conn ID URS
Concepts:
Prerouting (Mostly commom)
SIP->URS->ORS->RM-MCP
Routing - > IVR -> Routing -> Agent
PostRouting
SIP->

Day 4
Creating LRG's
Connection between RM &MCP 
under provisioning -> mcp->create lrg and add MCP under REsource assignment
and redource management selection choose RM

Genesys Routing Soln (Voice Routing)
1. SIP
Orchestration Platfrom(URS+ORS)
2. URS -Execustes the logic (Cassandra)/Routes call to agent using SIP (Incase on direct transfer from IVR Only Use URS no route)
3. ORS -Fetches from APP server & understands eecuts/SCXML code

debug - URS logs for any routing issues
Deployment process:
Genrate IPD from interactionProcees
Deploy the IPD on Config server by clicking on interactionProcees file
Loging to GA than go to Provisioning - > orchestration app (Seach project name)
Script object - MAP the patch of scxml scrip in configuration(IPD)
MAP under DN number the incoming number. Use the DN than in the 
VXML script to transfer to The actual route application(Use  Transfer node which will send it To URS and than exec script obj)
URS logs: app/genesys/logs use search tag: args
